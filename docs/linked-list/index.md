Linked list is collection of objects called node. Each node is linked to other node. If you want to iterate through all elements we should start from the first. (constant time: O(n) )

We can add unlimited element to LinkedList

## Doubly Linked List
An extended version of linked list is doubly linked list
The difference is each node will keep reference to next element and previous element. The last node does not has next element. The first node point to HEAD node as previous element.
